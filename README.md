Web front-end for the Litter Map project.

## Technologies

- Interactive map powered by [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/)
- User interface built with [solid](https://www.solidjs.com/)
- Build system written in [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp)
- Scripts and runtime dependencies bundled with [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/)

## Get started

Set up the configuration file:

- `cp config-template.json config.json`

Edit `config.json` and:

- Adjust the api host if necessary
- Fill in third party service access credentials

Install dependencies with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/):

- `pnpm i`

Build the app:

- `pnpm build`

Start local server:

- `pnpm serve`

In a separate terminal, start the proxy that combines the front-end and back-end services under one host URL:

- `pnpm proxy`

The app should now be available at http://localhost:9999

## Development

Build and then watch source files for changes that automatically trigger a rebuild:

- `pnpm watch`

### Dependencies

Install them with `pnpm` and just `import` them in the scripts. The build system is going to automatically roll everything into a self-contained bundle and insert it into the end product.

### Local testing

Use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) as an internet HTTPS proxy to the local HTTP proxy started with `pnpm proxy` for HTTPS support:

- `ngrok http 9999`

For example, certain browsers may silently [refuse to perform geolocation](https://www.ghacks.net/2017/03/14/firefox-55-geolocation-requires-secure-origin/) in an insecure context.

### Tips

Check which packages depend on a node package:

- `pnpm ll --depth 999 <package>`

## Known issues

- Firefox currently has a [bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1400856) which prevents source maps from working for scripts inlined inside the HTML document

## Caveats

- There appears to be no obvious way to enable keyboard input on the map without first clicking it. See open issue: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/35825194

- Since Windows uses back slashes (`\`) as path separators (which can be traced to a feature of MS-DOS 2.0), the build script might need significant [modifications](https://shapeshed.com/writing-cross-platform-node/#use-pathresolve-to-traverse-the-filesystem) to its path handling in order to run properly on Windows

### Build system

The build tasks are orchestrated with Gulp, which takes time to master but accommodates extreme flexibility and performance while also making possible a relatively concise formulation.
